Flix6
-----
- **Description**: This is a movies review app which allows visitors to search movies by title, and logged in users to favorite movies and rate & write comments about movies. 
- **Background**: This is a project from The Pragmatic Studio’s [Ruby on Rails course](https://pragmaticstudio.com/rails) whereby I built a separate, different application than in the videos. That allowed me to reinforce and cement what I learned in a different context.

- **Source code**: [https://github.com/waihon/flix6](https://github.com/waihon/flix6)
- **Remarks**: I took an initiative to practice TDD by writing unit tests, controller tests, and integration test. That was outside the scope of the course.
